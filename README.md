# CityCube

A fictional restaurant set in the ambiguously-named 'City', CityCube
provides a meal replacement for the people; gelatinous cubes of nutrients
packed into a tiny cube, easily consumable to provide quick sustenance in
a bustling and busy major metropolitan area.

This webapp provides account management, where orders can be 'made' and charged
to a finance account. Administrative functionality, such as adding new items
and manipulating database contents, is also provided.

## Install

:: To be explained ::


## Tools

This app uses several frameworks/libraries to showcase their capabilities in a small-scale environment:

Front end:
- [React](https://react.dev/) (front-end UI)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) (for single-page-application functionality)
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) (state management library)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (front-end tooling)

Back end:
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (API)
- [Turso/libSQL](https://turso.tech/) (lightweight relation database built on SQLite)
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/) (templating)

While this app could have been made with a minimal or less-complex set of libraries, it was an exercise in experimentation for the developer.
